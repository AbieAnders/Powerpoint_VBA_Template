This repository contains a template program that generates a simple presentation and a file containing explanations for some of the syntax and concepts involved.

To run VBA one needs a microsoft office application to be installed on the computer. This particular repository will focus on Powerpoint.
NOTE: Powerpoint must be installed on the computer in order to use visual basic which the web version of Powerpoint does not support.

To run VBA in Powerpoint, the developer ribbon must first be enabled in the settings menu. Then click the Visual Basic option which will open up a new window.
Right click under the project pane located on the left hand side of the window and select the 'module' option from within the 'insert' option.
This will create a new module for typing and running code.
